# Shape Framed Digits

A row of digits is displayed, each enclosed in a geometric shape — circles, triangles, squares, stars, or hearts. A text label at the top names the target shape (e.g. "Only circles"). The solver reads only the digits inside the named shape and ignores the rest, which are distractors in other shapes.
