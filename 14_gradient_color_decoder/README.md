# Gradient Color Decoder

A legend at the top maps distinct colors to digits (0–9) using colored shapes. Below, a wide horizontal strip shows the code as a sequence of colored segments that blend into each other at the boundaries. Markers and "?" labels below each segment ask the solver to match each color back to the legend to recover the digit.
