# Phrase Encoded Digits

Three visual variants that encode each code digit as a countable quantity:

- **Tally Marks** (`index_v1`) – classic tally marks (groups of five with a diagonal strike-through). The canvas is split into sections; the solver counts the marks in each section to get a digit.
- **Domino Chain** (`index_v2`) – a row of domino tiles. One half of each domino shows a pip count; the other half is the answer the solver must read.
- **Dice Roll** (`index_v3`) – a row of dice showing standard pip patterns. The solver counts the pips on each die to recover the code digits.
