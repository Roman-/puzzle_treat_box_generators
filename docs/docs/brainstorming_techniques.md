## mindmap classification, decomposition
- categories
- aspects
- components = words from the problem formulation

## Think of a thing without reality limits, aka Remove All Constraints
- If there were no reality limits, ...
- If complying with the laws of physics was optional, ...
- If time, cost, and scale were irrelevant, then ...
- If perfect information were available instantly, then ...
- If humans could gain abilities on demand, ...

## Solutions depend on the way you formulate the problem
- Formulate a problem as detailed as possible. Add more details to the formulation.
- Ideal final result. Clean, not detailed, method-neutral formulation
