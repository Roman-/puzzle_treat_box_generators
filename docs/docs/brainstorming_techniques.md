## Think of a thing without reality limits, aka Remove All Constraints
- If there were no reality limits, ...
- If complying with the laws of physics was optional, ...
- If time, cost, and scale were irrelevant, then ...
- If perfect information were available instantly, then ...
- If humans could gain abilities on demand, ...

## Solutions depend on the way you formulate the problem
- Formulate a problem as detailed as possible. Add more details to the formulation.
- Ideal final result. Clean, not detailed, method-neutral formulation

## Ask these thought-provoking questions
- How would I do it if I knew I could not fail?
- What assumptions am I making about this problem (and what if they are wrong)?
- What is the simplest version of the solution I can test right now?
- What one thing can I do (insert the time frame here - 1 day, 1 week, 1 month) that will make all other things either easier or unnecessary?
- If my idol (try 3 different people) had this problem, how would they solve it?
- Who else has faced a similar problem, and what did they do?
- What would this look like if it were easy and fun?
- If I had 1 million dollars to solve this problem, how would I approach it? What about $1?
- If I could outsource this entirely, who or what would I choose to solve it?
- What would I do if I had unlimited time but zero resources?
- What would I do if I had unlimited resources but only 1 day?
- If this problem were a movie plot, what would be the unexpected twist?
- How would I approach this if failure was the goal instead of success?
- What would a comedian say is the funniest solution to this problem?
- How would a robot solve this problem without human emotions or bias?
- If this problem could be solved by eliminating one rule, which rule would I break?
- What would this problem look like if it were solved in reverse?

## SCAMPER
- Substitute
- Combine
- Adapt
- Modify
- Put to another use
- Eliminate
- Rearrange

## Change any constant. Break default thinking by treating all assumptions as variables.
- State the problem in one sentence.
- List constants you’re assuming (time, user behavior, cost, medium, scale, sequence, ownership, skills).
- Flip one assumption:
    - Set it to zero
    - Make it infinite
    - Reverse it
    - Randomize it
    - Replace it with its opposite
- Ask: What solution exists under this new rule?
- Extract the insight, not the literal solution.
- Re-apply reality with that insight intact.

## Step back, change the scale of the problem. Reveal hidden structure by zooming far out or far in.
1. State the problem clearly. Assume: if you’re stuck, you’re at the wrong scale.
2. Change the scale deliberately:
    - Zoom out ×10, ×100, ×1000 (system, lifetime, civilization).
    - Zoom in ×10, ×100 (moment, action, interaction, decision).
3. Rephrase the problem at that scale.
4. Ask: What matters now? What disappears? What dominates?

### Prompts
- At civilization scale, what is this really about?
- At daily / minute scale, what actually happens?
- Over 10 years, what compounds?
- In one second, what decision matters?
- If this repeated a million times, what breaks?

## Apply the Lever (Domino Effect). Lower force to influence higher consequences?
### Identify leverage points where:
- One action repeats
- Others copy it
- Systems auto-respond
- Feedback loops exist

### Reduce input force:
- Earlier in the chain
- Closer to the bottleneck
- Where behavior compounds
