# Count circles – with colors

A colorful variation of the counting challenge. Each digit is hidden in a grid of filled circles. All circles are painted in one of four fixed colors: yellow, red, blue and green. For every scene you only need to count the circles painted with the scene's color.

Below each grid there is a small marker circle filled with the color you have to count, followed by a dash and a question mark. Count the matching circles in each grid (left‑to‑right) to reveal the 4‑digit code.

### Implementation notes
- Because each digit is from 0 to 9, the minimum cell size is again 3×3.
- The order of the colors is fixed: yellow, red, blue and green.
- Every circle is filled. Only the number of circles painted with the scene color equals the digit.
