# Bar chart

Each digit is encoded as the height of a bar in a simple bar chart. Horizontal grid lines with numbers on the left make it easy to read the values.

### Implementation notes
- The digits 0â€“9 map linearly to bar heights, 0 being empty and 9 the full height of the chart.
- Bars can have different fill colors and an optional outline.
- Horizontal grid lines can be solid or dashed with configurable color and thickness.
