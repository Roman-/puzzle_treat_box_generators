FYI initial query for generating index.html:
Generate a single web page app that does the following: 1. the user inputs N digits in text field, e.g. "4121" 2. the program makes a sorted array of K >= N numbers, each from 0 to 9, that contains all digits from user input, e.g. 12459 (K = 5, added random numbers: 5 and 9) 3. it assigns random and different colors to each digit. Use HSV so that Hue (0-359) diff is at least 30 between the two colors (so no two colors look same). Saturation and value: stick to random values s = 80%..100%, v = 80%..100% (pick one for the entire color set) 4. on html canvas, it draws all the K digits, followed by a circle colored that color. It has to display them in a nice sort of reference table, so that it is clear for a user which number has which color. 5. Finally, below that reference table it draws a wide rectangle (width almost matches canvas width). It chooses N points, one for each number that user inputs (in the same order), and uses that point to "encode" the initial number. Underneath that strap is a question mark indicating that a number is encoded here. And the rectangle itself is colored in horizontal gradient where where you've got random colors on the left and on the right, and in between them the gradient goes through n points, where each point is colored the assigned color.
