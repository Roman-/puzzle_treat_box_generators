# Emoji Code Scatter

A list of rows, each pairing an emoji word (e.g. "dog", "rocket") with a multi-digit number, resembling an index or dictionary. One emoji is highlighted at the bottom with an arrow pointing to "????" — the solver scans the list to find that emoji's row and reads the number as the code.
