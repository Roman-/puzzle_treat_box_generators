# Critique of Interpretation 1: Color-Based Label Selection

## Guideline Analysis

### "Instant affordance"
**ISSUE**: The puzzle does provide instant affordance - you see colored numbers and need to find one color. This is acceptable.

### "Creative > academic"
**ACCEPTABLE**: This is more of a visual search game than academic exercise.

### "Minimal or no text"
**ISSUE**: Requires the instruction "Find the RED number" - this is text, but minimal and unavoidable given the puzzle concept. The user description explicitly mentions "the child has to read the task" so some text is expected.

### "Visual clarity"
**ISSUE**: With many labels scattered at various angles, there could be visual noise. Labels might overlap or be hard to read when rotated significantly. Need to ensure non-overlapping placement and readable rotations.

### "Color-friendly"
**ACCEPTABLE**: Uses colors as the core mechanic which is appropriate for color printing.

### "Unambiguous digits"
**POTENTIAL ISSUE**: If colors are similar (e.g., red vs orange under certain printing conditions), the answer could be ambiguous. Need to ensure the answer color is distinct from all distractors.

### "Scales with N"
**ACCEPTABLE**: Works equally well for 3-5 digit codes.

### "Child-solvable, adult-pleasant"
**POTENTIAL ISSUE**: Very young children might not know color names or struggle to read "PURPLE" or "AQUA". Need simple, commonly known color names.

### "Failure-proof"
**ISSUE**: If two labels accidentally have very similar colors (due to printing variance), the puzzle could fail. Solution: ensure only ONE label has the target color, others must be clearly different.

### "Generator-friendly"
**ACCEPTABLE**: Easy to parameterize and randomize.

## Summary of Issues to Address
1. Ensure non-overlapping label placement
2. Limit rotation to readable angles
3. Use only distinct, easily named colors
4. Guarantee only ONE label matches the rule
