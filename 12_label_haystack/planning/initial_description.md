# Initial Description

Instead of encoding each digit individually, you take a bunch of variations of the numbers that have the exact same amount of digits as in the answer and just scatter them around the scene. With different positions, different rotation and so on.

These different answer candidates would differ in some criteria, for example color. So out of 10 different color variations you have to pick one, the one that you specify above.

So this is really the needle in the haystack problem and a reading challenge as well. So the child has to read the task to, for example, find the smallest label of all the labels on the scene and then find the one and then the one that is smallest is the answer and all other labels are not.
