# Sequence Pattern

Number sequences arranged in vertical columns separated by light lines, with a dashed separator above the answer row. Each column shows a series of digits following a simple arithmetic pattern (counting up, counting down, skipping by 2, etc.). The last position in each column is replaced with "?" — the solver continues the pattern to find the missing digit.
