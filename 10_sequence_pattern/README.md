# Sequence Pattern

Number sequences arranged in columns. Each column shows a series of digits following a simple arithmetic pattern (counting up, counting down, skipping by 2, etc.). The last position in each column is replaced with "?" — the solver continues the pattern to find the missing digit.

Comes in two visual variants:
- **Columns** (`index_v2`) – vertical columns separated by light lines, with a dashed separator above the answer row.
- **Train** (`index_v3`) – digits ride on a train of connected cars rolling left-to-right; the code digits are the hidden cars marked with "?".
