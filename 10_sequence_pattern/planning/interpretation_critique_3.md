# Critique of Interpretation 3: Circular/Cyclic Pattern Wheel

## Major Issues

### 1. Reading Order Ambiguity (Violates "Unambiguous digits")
In a circle, which direction do you read?
- Clockwise vs counter-clockwise
- Even with an arrow, children might read the wrong way
- Where does the sequence "start"? The entry point is ambiguous

### 2. Digit Order Problem (Violates "Failure-proof")
If "?" marks are at positions 3, 4, 5, 6 on the wheel:
- Reading clockwise gives one order
- Reading counter-clockwise gives reverse order
- Code "1234" vs "4321" depends on interpretation

### 3. Visual Complexity (Violates "Visual clarity")
- Circular text is harder to read than horizontal text
- Digits may need rotation to be readable, adding visual noise
- The direction arrow is additional visual clutter
- Smaller wheels = cramped digits; larger wheels = scattered elements

### 4. Pattern Recognition Difficulty (Violates "Child-solvable")
Following a pattern around a circle requires:
- Spatial tracking (where am I on the wheel?)
- Direction memory (which way am I going?)
- Pattern memory (what comes next?)

This is significantly harder than linear pattern recognition.

### 5. Space Inefficiency (Violates "Visual clarity")
A circle wastes canvas corners. To fit N elements comfortably, you need much more space than a linear arrangement.

### 6. Printing Issues (Violates "Readable when printed")
Rotated digits on a curve may become illegible when printed, especially on smaller paper sizes.

## Positive Aspects
- Visually interesting and creative
- The cyclical nature matches "repeating pattern" conceptually
- Could work for very simple patterns (length 2-3)

## Summary
The circular format introduces spatial complexity that overwhelms the pattern-finding task. The core puzzle mechanic gets lost in the visual gimmick.
