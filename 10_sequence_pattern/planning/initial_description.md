# Initial Description

**User Input:** A sequence pattern is given (1251251????51251), figure out what should be placed in places of '?'

## Core Concept
The puzzle presents a repeating numeric sequence with some digits replaced by question marks. The solver must identify the pattern and determine the missing digits.

## Example from User
`1251251????51251`

Breaking this down:
- The visible pattern appears to be "125" repeating
- The sequence would be: 1-2-5-1-2-5-1-?-?-?-?-5-1-2-5-1
- The missing digits (marked with ????) would be: 1-2-5-1 (continuing the "125" cycle)

## Key Elements
1. A repeating pattern of digits
2. Some positions are hidden/replaced with "?"
3. The solver identifies the pattern and fills in the blanks
4. The answer (code for the box) is the sequence of missing digits
