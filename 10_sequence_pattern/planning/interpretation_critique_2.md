# Critique of Interpretation 2: Multiple Parallel Sequences

## Major Issues

### 1. Instant Affordance Unclear (Violates "Instant affordance")
With multiple rows, it's not immediately obvious:
- That rows should be solved independently
- That answers should be read top-to-bottom
- That the final "?" in each row is what matters

The visual design doesn't inherently communicate the extraction method.

### 2. Text Dependency (Violates "Minimal or no text")
To clarify that each row gives one digit and they combine into a code, you'd likely need instructional text like "Find each missing digit" or numbered rows suggesting order.

### 3. Pattern Repetition May Not Be Clear (Violates "Visual clarity")
With different pattern lengths per row:
- Row 1: 3-7-3-7 (length 2)
- Row 2: 5-8-4-5-8-4 (length 3)

The visual rhythm is inconsistent, making patterns harder to spot. Misalignment between rows creates visual noise.

### 4. Cognitive Overhead (Violates "Child-solvable")
Solving N independent patterns, then combining results, is N+1 mental steps. For a 5-digit code, that's 6 cognitive tasks instead of one unified puzzle.

### 5. Answer Verification Problem
If a child misidentifies one pattern, they get one digit wrong. But there's no self-checking mechanism—nothing confirms the overall answer is correct.

### 6. Artificial Pattern Construction (Violates "Generator-friendly")
Designing patterns where the "next" digit is a specific value requires working backwards:
- To get "7" as next digit with pattern "37", fine
- To get "3" as next digit with pattern "37", need "73" instead
- This constraint makes some digit combinations awkward

## Positive Aspects
- Each row is independently solvable (partial credit)
- Scales naturally to 3-5 digits
- Each answer is unambiguous once pattern is identified

## Summary
The multi-row approach adds complexity without adding clarity. The lack of visual unity makes it feel like multiple puzzles rather than one cohesive challenge.
