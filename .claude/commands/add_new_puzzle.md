Develop the implementation of a new puzzle.

To start:
- create the new (next) directory.
- create idea.md inside, trying to develop the initial idea given in the prompt
- create new file idea_critique.md nearby. In it, argue with everything described in idea.md, including: why this puzzle will be visually difficult to solve, corner cases it will inevitably have, what settings it will lack, why the mechanics is imperfect.
- create new file idea_improved.md nearby. In it, build upon what's described in idea_critique.md to create the implementation plan.
- based on idea_improved.md, create html/js puzzle index.html with the implementation.
