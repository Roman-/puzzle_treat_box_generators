# stage 1: ideation

In planning/variations_ideas.md, Write down several ideas on how to change puzzle mechanics so it feels like a different puzzle.
Do not limit yourself and think through even the most crazy and unexpected ways that this puzzle can be turned into something else.
Apply techniques from docs/brainstorming_techniques.md, using mindmap extensively as your main one, identifying which aspects of the puzzle can be changed or tweaked.

# stage 2: discarding ideas
Think through what ideas clearly contradict the guidelines described in README.md in project root.
Discard them, leaving only 3 best candidates. Output their descriptions in planning/tweak1.md, planning/tweak2.md, planning/tweak3.md.

# stage 3: implementation

For each tweak, then copy-paste the puzzle's main index.html page file 3 times: tweak1.html, tweak2.html, tweak3.html.
Implement the ideas in each file created.

# Clean up
Delete files from planning/*.md when done.
