For a given puzzle, think what new parameters can be added to the generator to make it more interesting, engaging, and challenging.

To start:
- User provides a directory or a puzzle: e.g. 42_puzzle_name
- Understand the puzzle structure, mechanics, and overall look based on the html/js page.
- In this directory, create `planning` dir if it does not exist yet.
- Create planning/parameter_ideas.md with ideas for new parameters to add, split by category (e.g., creativity, layout enhancement, variety, engagement, etc.)
- Create planning/parameter_ideas_critique.md. Argue with every suggestion in planning/parameter_ideas.md.
- Based on planning/parameter_ideas_critique.md, pick only five parameters that makes the most sense to add to the puzzle.
- Copy-paste the puzzle's index.html, implement the new parameters, and save it as index_new_params.html in the same directory.
