# stage 1: ideation on tweaking the puzzle visual look & feel

In planning/variations_ideas.md, write down 19 ideas on how to change the puzzle visual look so feels different. Apply techniques from docs/brainstorming_techniques.md, using mindmap extensively as your main one, identifying which aspects of the puzzle you can tweak.

Do not limit yourself and brainstorm everything that comes to mind on changing every single aspect of the puzzle, or multiple at once.

Document your brainstorming session to planning/brainstorming_on_visuals.md.

# stage 2: picking ideas
Randomly pick 15 of the 19 ideas, discarding those which will clearly contradict the guidelines described in README.md in project root

# stage 3: creating pages
15 ideas, randomly split them into 3 groups of 5 ideas each.
Copy-paste the puzzle's .html page, having index_visuals1.html, index_visuals2.html, index_visuals3.html.
Implement each set of ideas in its own page, either by changing the puzzle look or introducing new parameters that will adjust it.
