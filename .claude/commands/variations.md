# stage 1: ideation

In planning/variations_ideas.md, Write down 28 ideas on how to change, tweak, improve the puzzle both visually and mechanically.
Including but not limiting to: changing the shapes, the fonts, the element locations relative to each other, changing colors to gradients or even pictures, adding an extra level of complexity or abstraction, adding a different interpretation to the objects of the puzzle, etc.
Do not limit yourself and brainstorm everything that comes to mind on changing every single aspect of the puzzle.
Each idea should add extra settings / setting group / controls to the puzzle to make it adjustable. Checkmarks, select boxes, range sliders, etc.

# stage 2: picking ideas
Think through what ideas clearly contradict the guidelines described in README.md in project root.
Discard them, leaving only 12 remaining ideas. Split those into 3 groups of 4 ideas each, output them in planning/group1_ideas.md, planning/group2_ideas.md, planning/group3_ideas.md.

# stage 3: implementation

For each group, then copy-paste the puzzle's main index.html page file 3 times: index_group1.html, index_group2.html, index_group3.html.
Implement the three groups of features on top of each file created.

# Clean up
Delete files from planning/*.md when done with _groupX.html pages.
