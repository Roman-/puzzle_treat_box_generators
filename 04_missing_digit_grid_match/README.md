# Missing Digit Grid Match

A grid-based puzzle where each of the four grids is identical except for one cell that is replaced with a `?`. The goal is to read the digits from the matching position in the other grids and combine them left to right to reveal the 4‑digit code.

Each grid cell is filled with the same bright colour across all four grids to help visually align the cells. Changing any option re-renders the preview.

## Customisation
- Number of rows and columns
- Spacing between the grids
- Font family and size
- Cell border thickness
- Option to toggle the coloured background

## Implementation notes
- The four missing digits are taken from the code input.
- Any change to the controls randomises the grids and colours.
